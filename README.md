# Filesystem Explorer

# Commands:
- jump <directory> (Changes the current directory)
- rem  <filename> (Force removes the file)
- list 		   (Lists all files in current directory including hidden attribute flags)
- listen [-normal|-log] (Either displays or logs (copy) any filesystem actions inside the current directory)
- stop (Stops the current listen command)
- copy <filename> [directory] (Duplicates a file after removing hidden attribute flags)
- cls
- exit
- help

(If no directory is specified for copy or listen, default is C:\KExplorer)

While this program can easily be replaced by others, 
it can still be used as an information gathering, reverse engineering, and logging program.

This program allows you to bypass any security hidden attributes to gain complete control over your filesystem.
